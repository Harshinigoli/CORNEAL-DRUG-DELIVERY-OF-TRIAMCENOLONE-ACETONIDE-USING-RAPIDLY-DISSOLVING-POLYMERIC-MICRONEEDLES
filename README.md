# CORNEAL-DRUG-DELIVERY-OF-TRIAMCENOLONE-ACETONIDE-USING-RAPIDLY-DISSOLVING-POLYMERIC-MICRONEEDLES
OBEJECTIVE

The project deals with a developing technique of drug delivery system for ocular problems-microneedles based delivery system. Over the years, microneedles have posed as a promising technique to deliver therapeutic compounds for chronic complications and diseases. The anterior and posterior segment eye diseases are highly challenging to treat due to their barrier properties and inaccessibility to the tissues. Direct injections though solve the problem but increases the risks of damaging the tissues and side effects thus gaining poor patient acceptability. Microneedles have proven to be a breakthrough and hence are an emerging technique for ocular delivery system as well.
Various drugs to be delivered using this technique are being studied in the course of the project. This report mainly focuses on the method development and characterization of triamcinolone acetonide. The method of preparation of microneedles is also described in the course of the report. The objective of the project is to develop a microneedle based ocular delivery system for these drugs. Triamcinolone acetonide is a drug of choice for eye inflammation caused due to injury or surgery. To deliver these drugs using microneedles for the treatment of their respective disease is the objective of the project.

CONCLUSION

Visual impairment and blindness are potentially the most devastating health problem worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that globally about 285 million people are visually impaired of which 39 million are blind, and 246 have a low vision. Hence it is important to work and explore in the field of microneedles and enhance public health, comport and needs. TA being one of the most effective drugs should be efficiently delivered which is partially possible through polymeric microneedles. MN particularly show promise in delivering molecules that do not possess optimal physicochemical properties and/or to deliver molecules across difficult-to-penetrate membranes, including the corneal epithelium.
